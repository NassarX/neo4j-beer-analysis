    "\n",
    "_For reference the dataset used for this project has been extracted from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ehallmar/beers-breweries-and-beer-reviews), released by Evan Hallmark. Even though the author does not present metada on the origin of the data it is probably a collection of open data from places like [beeradvocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com/)_.\n",

    "1. Which brewery produces the strongest beers according to ABV? [Hint: database has NaN values]\n",

    "    3. Users are connected together by their reviews to beers, taking into consideration the \"overall\" score they review as a weight, how many communities are formed from these relationships? How many users has the biggest community? [Please use limit of 1000 on beer-review-user path]]\n",
    "1. Using Graph Algorithms answer **one** of the following questions:\n",
